## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.7.2 or higher
- Dart SDK 3.0.0 or higher
- iOS/Android/Web development environment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd conference_management
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

## Usage

### Login Credentials (Mock Data)

**Member Account:**
- Email: `member@conference.gov`
- Password: Any password (mock authentication)
- Role: Select "Member"

**Admin Account:**
- Email: `admin@conference.gov`
- Password: Any password (mock authentication)
- Role: Select "Admin"

### RFID/Fingerprint Login

The RFID/Fingerprint button simulates device scanning with a 2-second delay. Select your role (Member/Admin) before clicking.

## Design Theme

- **Primary Color**: Green (#00C853)
- **Background**: White (#FFFFFF)
- **Text**: Black (#000000)
- **Accent Colors**: 
  - Success: Green
  - Error: Red
  - Warning: Orange
  - Info: Blue

## Backend Integration

This is a **prototype with mock data**. To integrate with a real backend:

1. Update API endpoints in `lib/services/api_service.dart`:
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'YOUR_BACKEND_URL';
```

2. Implement actual API calls in service files:
   - `lib/services/auth_service.dart`
   - Service files in `lib/services/` directory

3. Update models in `lib/models/` to match your API response structure

4. The app uses Dio with interceptors for:
   - Token management
   - Error handling
   - Request/response logging

## State Management

The app uses **Riverpod** for state management with the following providers:

- `authStateProvider`: Authentication state
- `agendaProvider`: Agenda items
- `votingProvider`: Voting sessions
- `documentProvider`: Documents
- `chatProvider`: Messages
- `memberProvider`: Members list
- `sessionProvider`: Sessions
- `attendanceProvider`: Attendance data

## Routing

Role-based routing with GoRouter ensures:
- Automatic redirection based on authentication status
- Member routes: `/member/*`
- Admin routes: `/admin/*`
- Route guards prevent unauthorized access

## Mock Data

The app includes comprehensive mock data in `lib/services/mock_data_service.dart`:
- Sample users (member and admin)
- Meeting agenda items
- Voting sessions with results
- Documents
- Chat messages
- Members list
- Attendance records

## Animations

Smooth animations throughout the app using:
- Page transitions
- FadeIn/FadeOut effects
- Slide animations
- Pulse effects for active states

## Responsive Design

Optimized for tablet devices with:
- Adaptive layouts
- Touch-friendly UI elements
- Large, easy-to-tap buttons
- Clear visual hierarchy

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real backend integration
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Offline mode
- [ ] Document annotation
- [ ] Video conferencing integration
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Dark theme
- [ ] Export reports to PDF
- [ ] Real-time updates via WebSocket
