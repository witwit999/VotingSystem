# VotingModel → DecisionModel Migration Complete ✅

## Overview

Successfully migrated the entire app from the legacy `VotingModel` (mock data) to the backend-integrated `DecisionModel`. All screens now work with the real backend API.

## Summary of All Fixes

### 1. ✅ Voting Provider
**File:** `lib/providers/voting_provider.dart`

**Changes:**
- Migrated from `VotingModel` to `DecisionModel`
- Uses backend `DecisionService` instead of `MockDataService`
- Finds open decisions across live sessions
- Fixed provider initialization to avoid Riverpod errors

---

### 2. ✅ Admin Voting Control Screen
**File:** `lib/features/admin/voting_control/screens/voting_control_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- Updated to use `DecisionModel`
- Changed field references:
  - `results.yes` → `tally.accepted`
  - `results.no` → `tally.denied`
  - `results.abstain` → `tally.abstained`
- Added null-safety for `decision.tally`

---

### 3. ✅ Admin Reports Screen
**File:** `lib/features/admin/reports/screens/reports_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- Updated `votingHistoryProvider` access (no longer `AsyncValue`)
- Changed `_buildVotingCard` to accept `DecisionModel`
- Updated all field references
- Changed labels from yes/no to accepted/denied

---

### 4. ✅ Member Voting Screen
**File:** `lib/features/member/voting/screens/voting_screen.dart`

**Status:** Already using backend integration - no changes needed!

---

### 5. ✅ Member Home Screen
**File:** `lib/features/member/home/screens/member_home_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- `isActive` → `isOpen`
- `question` → `description`
- `endTime` → `closeAt`
- Removed `userVote` tracking (requires separate API)
- Removed `hasVoted` logic (dead code)
- Simplified voting button (just "Vote Now" or "Voting Ended")

---

### 6. ✅ Admin Dashboard Screen
**File:** `lib/features/admin/dashboard/screens/admin_dashboard_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- `results.yes` → `tally.accepted`
- `results.no` → `tally.denied`
- `results.abstain` → `tally.abstained`
- Updated pie chart data
- Updated legend labels

---

### 7. ✅ Session Details Screen
**File:** `lib/features/admin/sessions/screens/session_details_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- Fixed "Open Decision" button visibility logic
- Removed complex time picker dialog (~220 lines)
- Implemented automatic 5-minute voting timer
- Simple confirmation dialog

---

### 8. ✅ Decision Service
**File:** `lib/services/decision_service.dart`

**Changes:**
- Added enhanced logging for debugging
- Logs closeAt timestamp in UTC and local time
- Logs request body and error responses

## Field Mapping Reference

| Old (VotingModel) | New (DecisionModel) | Type Change |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| `id` | `id` | ✅ Same |
| `title` | `title` | ✅ Same |
| `question` | `description` | ✅ Name change + nullable |
| `startTime` | `openAt` | ✅ Name change |
| `endTime` | `closeAt` | ✅ Name change |
| `isActive` | `isOpen` | ✅ Computed property |
| `results` | `tally` | ✅ Structure change |
| `results.yes` | `tally.accepted` | ✅ Name change |
| `results.no` | `tally.denied` | ✅ Name change |
| `results.abstain` | `tally.abstained` | ✅ Name change |
| `results.total` | `tally.total` | ✅ Computed |
| `results.yesPercentage` | `tally.acceptPercentage` | ✅ Based on activeBase |
| `results.noPercentage` | `tally.denyPercentage` | ✅ Based on activeBase |
| `results.abstainPercentage` | `tally.abstainPercentage` | ✅ Based on activeBase |
| `userVote` | *(removed)* | Requires separate API |

## Tally Calculation Differences

### Old VotingModel (Mock)
```dart
class VotingResults {
  final int yes;
  final int no;
  final int abstain;
  final int total;  // yes + no + abstain
  
  double get yesPercentage => (yes / total) * 100;
}
```

### New DecisionModel (Backend)
```dart
class DecisionTally {
  final int accepted;
  final int denied;
  final int abstained;
  final int valid;        // accepted + denied
  final int activeBase;   // active attendees
  
  int get total => accepted + denied + abstained;
  double get acceptPercentage => (accepted / activeBase) * 100;  // ✅ Based on activeBase
  bool get passed => accepted > denied;
}
```

**Key Difference:** Percentages are calculated against `activeBase` (number of active attendees), not just total votes!

## Complete Testing Flow

### Admin Workflow ✅

1. **Create Session**
   ```
   Sessions → Add Session → Enter name → Create
   Result: Session created (DRAFT)
   ```

2. **Open Session**
   ```
   Click "Open" button
   Result: Session status → LIVE
   ```

3. **Create Decision**
   ```
   Session Details → New Decision → Fill form → Create
   Result: Decision created (CLOSED)
   ```

4. **Open Decision**
   ```
   Click "Open Decision" → See confirmation → Confirm
   Result: Decision status → OPEN for 5 minutes
   ```

5. **Monitor Votes**
   ```
   Session Details → See live tally
   OR Voting Control → See chart
   ```

6. **Close Decision**
   ```
   Click "Close Decision" OR wait 5 minutes
   Result: Decision status → CLOSED, final tally calculated
   ```

### Member Workflow ✅

1. **View Active Session**
   ```
   Home Screen → See active session card
   ```

2. **View Active Decision**
   ```

## Provider Architecture

```
AuthProvider (JWT tokens)
    ↓
ApiService (REST client with interceptors)
    ↓
SessionService + DecisionService (Business logic)
    ↓
SessionProvider + DecisionProvider (State management)
    ↓
VotingProvider (Aggregates open decisions)
    ↓
UI Screens (Display and interactions)
```

## Backend Endpoints Used

### Sessions
- ✅ `POST /sessions` - Create session (DRAFT)
- ✅ `GET /sessions` - List all sessions
- ✅ `GET /sessions?status=LIVE` - List live sessions
- ✅ `POST /sessions/{id}/open` - Open session (DRAFT → LIVE)
- ✅ `POST /sessions/{id}/join` - Join session as attendee

### Decisions
- ✅ `POST /sessions/{id}/decisions` - Create decision (CLOSED)
- ✅ `GET /sessions/{id}/decisions` - List decisions for session
- ✅ `GET /decisions/{id}` - Get decision with tally
- ✅ `POST /decisions/{id}/open` - Open decision (CLOSED → OPEN, 5-min timer)
- ✅ `POST /decisions/{id}/close` - Close decision (OPEN → CLOSED)

### Voting
- ✅ `POST /decisions/{id}/votes` - Submit vote (ACCEPT/DENY/ABSTAIN)
- ✅ `GET /decisions/{id}/votes` - Get all votes

## Error Resolutions

### Error 1: Provider Initialization ✅
**Issue:** CurrentVotingNotifier modified SessionNotifier during initialization

**Fix:** Removed automatic loading from constructor, added manual trigger in screens

---

### Error 2: Session Not Appearing After Creation ✅
**Issue:** Created sessions had DRAFT status, app queried for LIVE

**Fix:** Changed to load ALL sessions after creation, not filtered

---

### Error 3: "Open Decision" Button Not Showing ✅
**Issue:** Logic error in button visibility condition

**Fix:** `if (decision.status == DecisionStatus.closed)` instead of complex logic

---

### Error 4: Member Home Screen Crash ✅
**Issue:** Accessing `voting.isActive`, `voting.question`, `voting.endTime`

**Fix:** Changed to `voting.isOpen`, `voting.description`, `voting.closeAt`

---

### Error 5: Admin Dashboard Crash ✅
**Issue:** Accessing `voting.results.yes/no/abstain`

**Fix:** Changed to `voting.tally.accepted/denied/abstained`

---
