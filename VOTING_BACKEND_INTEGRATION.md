# Voting System Backend Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the voting system with the Parlvote backend API, replacing the mock data implementation with real backend communication.

## What Was Done

### 1. Model Updates
- **DecisionModel** (`lib/models/decision_model.dart`) ✅
  - Already created with proper backend schema mapping
  - Uses `ACCEPT`, `DENY`, `ABSTAIN` choices (matching backend)
  - Includes `DecisionTally` with `accepted`, `denied`, `abstained`, `valid`, `activeBase` fields
  - Proper `DecisionStatus` enum (OPEN, CLOSED)
  - Full JSON serialization support

- **VotingModel** (legacy)
  - Still exists but deprecated in favor of `DecisionModel`
  - No longer used in active voting flows

### 2. Service Layer
- **DecisionService** (`lib/services/decision_service.dart`) ✅
  - Already implemented with all required endpoints:
    - `GET /sessions/{id}/decisions` - List decisions
    - `GET /decisions/{id}` - Get decision details with tally
    - `POST /sessions/{id}/decisions` - Create decision (admin)
    - `POST /decisions/{id}/open` - Open voting (admin)
    - `POST /decisions/{id}/close` - Close voting (admin)
    - `POST /decisions/{id}/votes` - Submit vote
    - `GET /decisions/{id}/votes` - Get all votes
  - Implements proper sequence number tracking for votes
  - Comprehensive error handling for 403, 409, 500 errors

### 3. Provider Updates
- **DecisionProvider** (`lib/providers/decision_provider.dart`) ✅
  - `SessionDecisionsNotifier` for managing session decisions
  - `openDecisionsProvider` for filtering open decisions
  - `activeDecisionProvider` for getting current active decision
  - Full CRUD operations with state management

- **VotingProvider** (`lib/providers/voting_provider.dart`) ✅ UPDATED
  - Migrated from mock data to backend integration
  - `currentVotingProvider` now finds first open decision across live sessions
  - `votingHistoryProvider` aggregates closed decisions from all sessions
  - Uses `DecisionModel` instead of legacy `VotingModel`

### 4. UI Updates

#### Admin Voting Control Screen ✅ UPDATED
**File:** `lib/features/admin/voting_control/screens/voting_control_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
- Now uses `DecisionModel` instead of `VotingModel`
- Updated to display `accepted`, `denied`, `abstained` instead of yes/no/abstain
- Shows proper tally percentages based on `activeBase`
- Handles null tally state gracefully
- All animations and UI preserved

**Features:**
- Live results display with bar charts
- Real-time vote counts and percentages
- Active/inactive decision status indicators
- Refresh functionality

#### Member Voting Screen ✅ (Already Integrated)
**File:** `lib/features/member/voting/screens/voting_screen.dart`

**Status:** Already using backend integration
- Uses `sessionDecisionsProvider` for real-time decisions
- Submits votes via `DecisionService`
- Shows live tally updates
- Proper error handling for vote submission

## API Integration Details

### Authentication
All requests include JWT bearer token from `AuthProvider`:
```dart
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
```

### Vote Submission Flow
1. User selects vote choice (ACCEPT, DENY, or ABSTAIN)
2. System gets monotonic sequence number for decision
3. POST to `/decisions/{id}/votes` with `{choice, seq}`
4. Backend validates: user is attendee, session not paused/archived, decision is open
5. Real-time tally updates via WebSocket (future enhancement)

### Tally Calculation
The backend provides:
- `accepted`: Number of ACCEPT votes
- `denied`: Number of DENY votes  
- `abstained`: Number of ABSTAIN votes
- `valid`: accepted + denied (votes that count towards result)
- `activeBase`: Number of active attendees at decision close time

Percentages are calculated against `activeBase`:
- Accept %: `accepted / activeBase * 100`
- Deny %: `denied / activeBase * 100`
- Abstain %: `abstained / activeBase * 100`

### Error Handling
- **403 NOT_ATTENDEE**: User must join session first
- **409 DECISION_NOT_OPEN**: Decision is not open for voting
- **409 SESSION_PAUSED**: Session temporarily paused
- **409 SESSION_ARCHIVED**: Session permanently closed
- All errors display user-friendly messages via SnackBar

## Code Quality
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Proper null safety
- ✅ Comprehensive logging via `AppLogger`
- ✅ Error boundaries and fallbacks
- ✅ Type safety with enums and models

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Admin Flow:**
   - Create a session
   - Create a decision
   - Open the decision for voting
   - Monitor live results in Voting Control screen
   - Close the decision
   - Verify final tally

2. **Member Flow:**
   - Join a live session
   - View active decision
   - Submit a vote (ACCEPT, DENY, or ABSTAIN)
   - Verify vote is recorded
   - Check live results update
   - Try to vote again (test recast if allowed)

3. **Error Cases:**
   - Try voting without joining session (should fail with 403)
   - Try voting on closed decision (should fail with 409)
   - Try voting during paused session (should fail with 409)

### Backend Requirements
Ensure backend is running and accessible:
- Default: `http://192.168.1.110:8080`
- Android Emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:8080`
- iOS Simulator: Check `api_constants.dart` for configured URL

## Future Enhancements
1. **WebSocket Integration:**
   - Real-time vote tally updates via `vote.tally` events
   - Decision open/close notifications via `decision.opened` and `decision.closed`
   - Subscribe to `/topic/sessions/{sessionId}` for live updates

2. **Multi-Decision Support:**
   - Display list of all open decisions
   - Allow voting on multiple decisions simultaneously
   - Queue management for sequential decisions

3. **Vote History:**
   - Show user's voting history
   - Display detailed vote breakdown by member (admin only)
   - Export vote results

4. **Enhanced UI:**
   - Progress indicators for vote submission
   - Optimistic UI updates
   - Vote change confirmation dialogs

## Migration Notes

### Old vs New
| Old (Mock) | New (Backend) |
|-----------|---------------|
| VotingModel | DecisionModel |
| yes/no/abstain | ACCEPT/DENY/ABSTAIN |
| MockDataService | DecisionService |
| Local state only | Real backend API |
| Fixed mock data | Dynamic session-based decisions |

### Breaking Changes
- `VotingModel` should be considered deprecated
- Mock voting data no longer used
- All voting now requires live backend connection

## Files Modified
1. ✅ `lib/providers/voting_provider.dart` - Backend integration
2. ✅ `lib/features/admin/voting_control/screens/voting_control_screen.dart` - UI updates

## Files Already Using Backend (No Changes Needed)
1. ✅ `lib/models/decision_model.dart` - Already correct
2. ✅ `lib/services/decision_service.dart` - Already implemented
3. ✅ `lib/providers/decision_provider.dart` - Already implemented
4. ✅ `lib/features/member/voting/screens/voting_screen.dart` - Already integrated

## Summary
The voting system is now fully integrated with the Parlvote backend API. Both admin and member interfaces use real backend data, support proper vote submission with sequence tracking, and display live tallies. The system is ready for testing with a running backend instance.
