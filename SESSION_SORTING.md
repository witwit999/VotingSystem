# Session Sorting - Active Sessions First

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Sessions are now sorted to show the most important ones first, making it easier for both admins and members to find active sessions.

## 📊 **Sorting Logic**

### Admin View (All Sessions):

**Priority Order:**
```
1. LIVE     (🟢 Active sessions - highest priority)
2. DRAFT    (🟡 Sessions being prepared)
3. PAUSED   (🔵 Temporarily paused sessions)
4. CLOSED   (⚫ Ended sessions)
5. ARCHIVED (⚪ Historical sessions - lowest priority)
```

**Secondary Sort:**
- Within each status group, sessions are sorted by **creation date** (newest first)

**Example Display:**
```
Sessions List:
├── 🟢 LIVE: Budget Discussion 2025
├── 🟢 LIVE: Morning Session
├── 🟡 DRAFT: Evening Session (being prepared)
├── 🟡 DRAFT: Healthcare Reform (being prepared)
├── 🔵 PAUSED: Infrastructure Meeting (on break)
├── ⚫ CLOSED: Previous Budget Session
└── ⚪ ARCHIVED: Old Session
```

### Member View (Live Sessions Only):

**Priority Order:**
- LIVE sessions only (filtered)
- Sorted by **creation date** (newest first)

**Example Display:**
```
Active Sessions:
├── Budget Discussion 2025 (created today)
├── Morning Session (created 2 hours ago)
└── Emergency Meeting (created yesterday)
```

## 💻 **Implementation**

### Admin Sessions Screen:

```dart
List<SessionModel> _sortSessions(List<SessionModel> sessions) {
  final sortedSessions = List<SessionModel>.from(sessions);
  
  // Define priority order: LIVE > DRAFT > PAUSED > CLOSED > ARCHIVED
  final statusPriority = {
    SessionStatus.live: 1,
    SessionStatus.draft: 2,
    SessionStatus.paused: 3,
    SessionStatus.closed: 4,
    SessionStatus.archived: 5,
  };
  
  sortedSessions.sort((a, b) {
    final aPriority = statusPriority[a.status] ?? 99;
    final bPriority = statusPriority[b.status] ?? 99;
    
    // Primary sort: by status priority
    final priorityComparison = aPriority.compareTo(bPriority);
    if (priorityComparison != 0) return priorityComparison;
    
    // Secondary sort: by creation date (newest first)
    return b.createdAt.compareTo(a.createdAt);
  });
  
  return sortedSessions;
}
```

### Member Home Screen:

```dart
// Filter and sort active sessions (newest first)
final activeSessions = sessions
    .where((s) => s.isActive)
    .toList()
  ..sort((a, b) => b.createdAt.compareTo(a.createdAt));
```

## 📱 **User Experience**

### For Admins:

**Before:**
- Sessions appeared in random or creation order
- Hard to find active sessions
- Had to scroll to find important sessions

**After:**
- ✅ LIVE sessions always at top
- ✅ DRAFT sessions next (can be opened)
- ✅ PAUSED sessions visible
- ✅ CLOSED and ARCHIVED at bottom
- ✅ Easy to manage active sessions

### For Members:

**Before:**
- Active sessions in random order

**After:**
- ✅ Newest active sessions first
- ✅ More recent sessions prioritized
- ✅ Logical ordering

## 🔍 **Logging**

When sessions are displayed, you'll see:

```
🐛 SessionsScreen: Sorted 5 sessions (LIVE first)
```

This confirms the sorting is working.

## 🎯 **Benefits**

1. **Better UX:**
   - Most important sessions (LIVE) always visible first
   - No need to scroll to find active sessions
   - Clear visual hierarchy

2. **Workflow Optimization:**
   - Admins can quickly find sessions to manage
   - Members see newest active sessions first
   - Logical grouping by status

3. **Consistency:**
   - Same sorting logic across the app
   - Predictable behavior

## 🧪 **Testing**

### Test Scenario:

**Setup:**
```
Create these sessions in order:
1. Session A - DRAFT
2. Session B - DRAFT → Open (now LIVE)
3. Session C - DRAFT
4. Session D - DRAFT → Open → Close (now CLOSED)
```

**Expected Order in Admin View:**
```
1. Session B (LIVE) ← Active session at top
2. Session C (DRAFT)
3. Session A (DRAFT)
4. Session D (CLOSED) ← Closed session at bottom
```

**Expected in Member View:**
```
1. Session B (LIVE) ← Only live session shown
```

## ✨ **Visual Indicators**

Sessions are now visually organized with:

1. **Position:** LIVE sessions at top
2. **Badge Color:** Green for LIVE stands out
3. **Gradient:** LIVE sessions use bright gradient
4. **Actions:** LIVE sessions show active management options

## 📝 **Summary**

### Admin View:
- ✅ Sorted by status priority (LIVE first)
- ✅ Secondary sort by creation date
- ✅ All sessions visible with status badges
- ✅ Easy to identify what needs attention

### Member View:
- ✅ Only LIVE sessions shown
- ✅ Sorted by creation date (newest first)
- ✅ Clear, focused view
- ✅ Easy to find latest sessions

## 🎊 **Result**

**LIVE sessions are always prominently displayed at the top!**

This makes it much easier for:
- **Admins** to manage active sessions
- **Members** to find and join current sessions
- **Everyone** to see what's happening now

The sorting happens automatically whenever sessions are loaded or refreshed. 🚀
